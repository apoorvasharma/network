#Ricart Agarwala Algorithm Implementation

## A demonstartion of Ricart Agarwala algorithm, using Lamport's Logial clock for single Resource

#### Each device established a *TCP connection* with every other device. When trying to accedd a resource they deviced pass messages amongst themselves and decide who gets the preference. A *remote server* which writes down whatever messages it gets in a file to simulates a ctitical reource.

####I have preferred threads over using *epoll* or *select* to provide better esponse time and take advantage of CPUs which can run more threads



##Usage

#### 1.change 'N' in *client.h* as per requirement .
#### 2.run *make*
#### 3.Put appropriate addresss in *address.txt* and *res.h*
#### 4.Start server with *./res*
#### 5.Start clients with *client 0,client 1,........* in no particular order 


##### Note: Might require minor changes to work for beyond 10 devices.
