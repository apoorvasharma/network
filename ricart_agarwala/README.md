#Ricart Agarwala Algorithm Implementation

#### A demonstartion of Ricart Agarwala algorithm, using Lamport's Logial clock
Each device established a *TCP connection* with every other device. When trying to accedd a resource they deviced pass messages amongst themselves and decide who gets the preference. The resource is a *remote server* which writes down whatever messages it gets in a file  to simulate a ctitical reource.

Note: Might require minor changes to work for beyond 10 deviced
